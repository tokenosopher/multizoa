No, not the planet - the little pockmarks of light that you see growing on it. Our cities. Our towns. Our villages. Our farms. Our factories. Our roads. Our bridges. Our power lines. Our pipelines. Our railroads. Our airports. Our ports. Our schools. Our hospitals. Our homes. Our businesses. Us.

Simply put, a multizoa organism [^1] is an organism whose fundamental structural and functional unit is the human. This is similar to how the fundamental structural and functional unit of a multicellular organism is the cell.

We believe that human society is a multizoa organism, and that analyzing human society through this lens offers valuable insights into our place in the universe and our potential future as a species.
