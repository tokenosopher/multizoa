No, not the planet - the little pockmarks of light that you see growing on it. Our cities. Our towns. Our villages. Our farms. Our factories. Our roads. Our bridges. Our power lines. Our pipelines. Our railroads. Our airports. Our ports. Our schools. Our hospitals. Our homes. Our businesses. Us.

Simply put, a multizoa organism [^1] is an organism whose fundamental structural and functional unit is the human. This is similar to how the fundamental structural and functional unit of a multicellular organism is the cell. What this means is that human society is a multizoa organism growing on the surface of Earth, kind of like moss is a multicellular organism growing on the surface of a tree.

<span style={imgDescStyle}><em>Moss on tree is a multicellular organism, just like human society on Earth above is a multizoa organism. Also, is this moss in the shape of Italy in the middle?</em></span>



And just like a multicellular organisms, a multizoa organism like our human society breathes, feeds and can reproduce, and can do so much more.

This website discusses the view of our worldwide human society as a multizoa organism, and aims to show that analyzing human society through this lens offers valuable insights into our place in the universe and our potential future as a species.
