# Chapter V – Do Human Societies Evolve?

So then, what about evolution? We’ve ticked off how human society can be considered a multizoa organism - an organism comprised of many animals. We’ve analyzed its feeding habits, pinning down fossil fuels as its number one feeding preference. We’ve touched on how it can reproduce - by colonizing other planets and thus having emo multizoa offpring. However, another basic characteristic of organisms is their ability to evolve over generations. Would multizoa organisms like human society evolve from one generation to the next?

It doesn’t take the brilliant mind of Dr. Who to suspect that they do. For example, the human society on Mars would inherit from the very beginning the technological developments that took thousands of years for Earth’s human society to develop: Writing, electricity, mechanical transportation, the toilet, IT, not to mention the treasure trove of ideas that lurks beneath the surface of our society, and would be able to build on their foundation from the very beginning. What would that mean for the way Mars’ cities will be built, for their means of transport, for the way that the people of this organism will come to make decisions together, for the kind of energy source this organism will extract from its surroundings (hint hint to the subject of the last chapter)? The Mars colony will definitely get a jumpstart to its beginnings that Earth’s society never had, and will have the opportunity to become much more developed than its parent organism as a consequence. Which is fine, because every parent wants to see their child go farther than they did, except when they’re brats.

Now imagine that human society were to suddenly reproduce on a hundred different planets, meaning each one would be a different colony. Of course, this is people we’re talking about, so each colony would be different, depending on the kind of planet that they reproduce on, the people that would establish it, the blueprint that the people who would be establishing it would be drawing their design from, on what kind of music everyone there would be into, and so on. And it’s easy to imagine that even though all of these societies would be established with the best of intentions by the people in them, some of these colonies would emerge as especially promising, better able to survive in their environments and to establish colonies themselves after a period of “growing up”. In other words, these promising multizoa organisms would be “naturally selected” to perpetuate their kind, and establish colonies of their own that build upon that way of being. Now I’m sure you’ve heard of natural selection before, and I don’t mean naturally selecting that chocolate fudge cake at the store…

Evolutionary theory basically describes natural selection as the more successful survival and reproduction of some organisms in comparison to others due to their particular traits, and holds it as one of the main mechanisms which shape the evolution of different species in nature. The little example just mentioned points to the fact that natural selection applies to multizoa organisms as much as it does to multicellular ones, which is good because having evolution without natural selection is like having toes without toenails...it just wouldn't feel right.

Now I know what you’re thinking: “Why should I care that multizoa organisms can evolve?” Well, because if multizoa organisms evolve through the process of natural selection just like we know life on Earth has, then just imagine how the universe will look like a few hundred billion years from the time Earth established its first colony on Mars, after multizoa life had the chance to cycle through a few generations. What we might find is that this wouldn’t be Kansas anymore, because multizoa life would mushroom into a dazzling display of different shapes and sizes as it would extend farther and farther. We wouldn’t just have multizoa plants rooted on the surface of planets like our human society is, we would also have multizoa organisms evolved into huge starships capable of carrying millions of people through the cosmos - and these would be the equivalent of multizoa animals. There would probably be mulitzoa organisms living underwater on some planets as well - multizoa marine life. In other words, if multizoa organisms evolve through the process of natural selection, then given time and multizoa reproduction the cosmos would come to be brimming with life, with multizoa plants and animals of various kinds, adapted to various kinds of environments - and that’s what multizoa organisms hold the promise of being able to achieve: breathe life into the silent cosmos, like cellular life breathed life into our planet.
