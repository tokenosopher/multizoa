# Epilogue

In the epilogue, I could have talked about money as a multizoa
hormone more. Or, I could have referred to human society’s
endocrine system [^1], and how some people are endocrine humans,
releasing money into human society. I could have listed some of
the other hormones of human society, such as coffee, or I could
have had some coffee and forgotten about this chapter
altogether, but no. Instead, what I want to close off with is what
my version of the ideal world would look like. That, and peanuts.

The ideal world is one in which no one does repetitive labour,
because all of that type of work would be done by robots who love
that stuff, and with that there'd be no more people working to
make ends meat because there’d be no reason for it, so every
single human being would be out there to have fun and enjoy their
time in the world. Also, peanuts are not actually nuts like
chestnuts or cashews, they're really a type of legume, which
makes them vegetables.

A world in which worries like hunger, thirst, lack of shelter is so
far from everyone's minds, it's only talked about in history
textbooks. Also, someone once pushed a peanut to the top of
Pike’s Peak (14,100 feet) using his nose in 4 days, 23 hours, 47
minutes and 3 seconds. Why? We can only assume it's because
the guy's pants had no pockets to carry the peanut in.

A world in which everybody's as social with everyone they meet
as snakes in a snake pit, or drunken best friends:

  always loved you. No, I have a picture of you naked in my wallet.
  Wait, what?

[^1]:
    In classical biology, the endocrine system is the collection of glands
    that produce hormones that regulate metabolism, growth and
    development, tissue function, sexual function, reproduction, sleep,
    and mood, among other things.
