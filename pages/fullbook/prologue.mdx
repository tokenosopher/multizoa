# The mildly serious Prologue (...before the less seriously styled book)

Welcome, my dear readers, to this odd piece of literature. I'll let the book speak for itself, so the only thing that I'd like to address in the intro is the style of writing employed. Many will condemn it. Books that talk about our society are usually dry and matter-of-fact, and here I am, joking around while discussing a new way of looking at our world, like I'm doing it while sitting around with my friends in fifth grade recess. Some of these jokes, as I'm sure at least a few of you will want to point out, are not even funny! (How dare you?) So why did I go through the trouble of writing the book this way?

Frankly, because it makes it easier to write it. I am human (hope that clears the air), and we live in the 21st century, where the most precious currency is human attention, and where fun stuff looms at every corner: Hanging out with friends, hatha yoga, video games, social media, amazing movies, amusement parks, traveling, bar hopping, you name it. And I'm the kind of person that loves most of these things, so I don't know about you, but in order for me to sit down and write a book, I need to make it fun for myself. This style of writing does just that.

Many times, the jokes that transpired in the book surprised even me, and made me chuckle as I wrote them. Writing the book this way made me look forward to sitting down and seeing what my disturbed mind came up with next. Sometimes, the jokes were so rough that I couldn't even leave them in, but they added to the fun of creating this little gem. So if, while reading the book, you come across a joke that you don't find funny at all, take solace in the fact that you know the reason why it's there: Because I found it funny, and that helped me write the next line. My hope was also that, in lambasting me for putting a joke in, or in laughing with another one, you might find the process of reading a book, which is so last century, more fun as well.

And now, on with the show.
