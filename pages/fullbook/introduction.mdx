# Introduction

Before the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists were called natural philosophers. And that wasn’t taken to mean philosophers who didn’t wear any make-up and just went with a natural look. In fact, have you seen the wigs that some of these people were wearing? Ain’t nothing natural about that.
