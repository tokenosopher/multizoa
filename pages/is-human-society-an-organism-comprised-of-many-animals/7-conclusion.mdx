# Conclusion

This paper aimed to introduce the concept of human society as a multizoa organism, i.e. an
organism made of many animals, and to provide a brief overview of some of the applications of
multizoa theory. Crucially, it did not aim to exhaust the list of applications, but rather to lay the
groundwork for their future exploration.

Instead of having human society and Earth be part of a single organism as the Gaia theory
proposes, multizoa theory defines human society as a plant-like multizoa organism that is rooted on
Earth’s surface. However, that does not minimize the extreme importance of the planet in human
society’s survival. As a plant’s survival depends on the health of the soil it is planted in, so too does a
plant-like multizoa organism depend on the health of the planet it is ‘planted’ in. The process of
evolution through natural selection on Earth has led to the development of plants that have an
intimate relationship with the soil that they are surrounded by, where they continually replenish it
with nutrients just as they extract the nutrients that they need, and that may be an evolutionary lesson
for multizoa organisms – no known stationary plants destroy the soil that they are in, and that may
just be because the process of multicellular evolution through natural selection has deemed such a
“trait” maladaptive. This could suggest that human society as a multizoa organism may be most
successful in its survival and reproduction during the process of multizoa natural selection by treating
Earth in a sustainable way.

In emphasizing the unitary nature of the worldwide human society, multizoa theory does not seek
to diminish the importance of each individual human which makes it up. On the contrary, the health
of a multizoa organism is dependent on the health of each person that is part of that organism, just
like the health of a multicellular organism is dependent upon the health of the cells which constitute
it. Moreover, multizoa theory proposes that the intelligence of a multizoa organism is partly
predicated upon the autonomy of its underlying people, upon the number of people within the society
that have their basic necessities met unconditionally, and are free to explore other activities. This is
based on the parallel with neurons in the associative cortices, which are thought to be responsible for
the higher-order thinking processes within the human brain. [^1] Within classical biology, intelligence is
thought to be an important factor in determining the ability of an organism to survive selection
pressures and to reproduce, and the same may apply to multizoa organisms. These are just some of
the ways in which multizoa theory values the life of each individual person that makes up a society.

Finally, from a metabiological perspective, the similarity between multicellular and multizoa
organisms cannot help but bring to mind the concept of self-similarity. A self-similar unit is one that is
exactly or mostly similar to parts of itself. [^2] Going one step above (or rather, below), there is also self-similarity between individual cells and the multicellular organisms that form it. After all, the name
given to the specialized structures within cells is “organelles”, since they are reminiscent of the organs
of multicellular organisms. Individual cells have been shown to display primitive forms of virtually all
features of multicellular organisms, including sensory processing via vision, intelligence, social
cohesion, and others. [^2] Self-similarity is a property of fractals, which have previously been associated
with other natural phenomena.35 With the addition of multizoa theory, we can now trace self-similar
patterns between biological entities that exist at three different orders of magnitude– cells, which are
made of interdependent molecules, multicellular organisms, which are made of interdependent cells,
and multizoa organisms, which are made of interdependent humans. This self-similarity is
approximate rather than exact, since there are features which distinguish the biological units that exist
at each order of magnitude. Nevertheless, it is a feature prominent enough to warrant attention, and
perhaps to encourage further investigation.
