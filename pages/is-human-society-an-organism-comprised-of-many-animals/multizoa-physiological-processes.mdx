# Multizoa physiological processes

As a multizoa organism, human society does a lot of what multicellular organisms do, only at a
much larger scale.

## Human society feeds:

In 2018, approximately 85% of the world’s energy came from fossil fuels. [^1] This energy is
extracted from the ground using specialized machinery, which can be seen as forming human society’s
root system (Figure 3). Of course, other nutrients are essential to human society’s survival, such as
water, as well as animal- and plant-derived nutrients. However, without fossil fuels to supply the
world’s energy right now, society would not be able to support the processing, transportation and
consumption of all the other nutrients, as well as its underlying humans, and it would essentially
break down and collapse. Therefore, it can be said that human society feeds, and its main source of
energy comes from fossil fuels.

## Human society breathes:

In 2013, human society consumed approximately 41 Gt of oxygen. [^2] Oxygen is essential for
the survival of the biological component of human society, as well as for the processing of fossil fuel
energy, and would not be able to survive without it.

## Human society grows:

The human population of human society has grown from 1.65 billion in the year 1900 to
approximately 7.7 billion in 2019. [^3] The occupied landmass of human society has also grown
significantly, from 2.52 billion hectares in the 1900 to about 5 billion hectares in 2015. Currently, the
entire landmass of Earth occupied by humans amounts to about 50% of the entire habitable landmass
of Earth. [^4] Interestingly, only about 2 percent of that habituated landmass accounts for the world’s
urban land, which includes cities and towns. The rest is used for agriculture, like cropland and grazing.
The growth of human society shows no signs of stopping, with an estimated 11.8 billion people
projected to live by 2100, and with land use predicted to increase as well. [^5]

## Human society is on track to reproduce:

One of the defining goals of human society in the 21st century seems to be that of establishing
a colony on another planet. Multizoa theory recognizes the establishment of such a colony as multizoa
reproduction. Creating a new city on Earth, although potentially beneficial for human society, is not
considered multizoa reproduction, but rather an addition to human society’s body, due to the subject
of integration and interdependence outlined above. More specifically, a new city anywhere on the
planet would be subject to that same process of integration and interdependence that the rest of
human society experiences to one degree or another. In contrast, a colony on another planet would
be largely independent from its parent society, due to the sheer distance between any two planets.
For example, it takes a radio message an average of 12.5 minutes to travel from Earth to Mars or viceversa, depending on how far they are from each other in orbit due to speed of light limitations. [^6] This

means that although there might be information transmission taking place between the two planetary
societies, the information being created and transmitted within one society would not be readily
available to the other society (e.g. they would not share the same internet), but rather would have to
be actively communicated to the other society, similar to how two people communicate their thoughts
to one another via active speech. Also, the proposed technology for physically travelling between
Earth and Mars would mean anywhere from one month to several of travelling through inhospitable
space. [^6]

This means that the two societies – the Earth-bound one and the Mars-bound one will grow
independently of one another, both physically and in terms of information transmission, and
anthropological evidence shows that when two human populations are separated and allowed to
develop independently, they develop different customs, values, technologies, ideals, etc. [^7] This would
make the population of people on the two different planets two different multizoa organisms, that
might have some amount of information transmission and travel between them, but that would be by
and large separate.
