# Is Human Society an Organism Made of Many Animals?

Author: Narcis Marincat

## Abstract

Social organism theories of the past have defined human societies as
“biological organisms”, similar to animals or plants. This present work draws from
the recent technological breakthroughs in both biology and astronomy to define
the worldwide human society as a “multizoa organism”, i.e. an organism made of
many animals. The paper then puts forth the idea that as a multizoa organism,
human society is subject to some of the same biological processes that apply to
other organisms, such as the natural cycles of growth, feeding and reproduction,
the principles of evolution through natural selection, and the dangers of
evolutionary pressures. Finally, it argues that war can be understood as a multizoa
disease that decreases the chances of a society to survive in its environment and
reproduce, thus providing a purely biological reasoning against the use of warfare.
