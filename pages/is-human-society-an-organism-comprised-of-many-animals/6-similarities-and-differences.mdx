# Multicellular and multizoa organisms – Similarities and differences

## Vision – An example of similarity

Some of the similarities between multizoa and multicellular organisms are truly striking. For
example, it is a well-established fact that the images we consciously perceive as vision are not in fact
the raw visual footage falling on the retina. [^1] If we were to perceive the images that come through
the eye directly as they fall on the retina, we would have a blurry, upside down image that constantly
shifts due to the eye’s micromovements, with a blind spot in the upper visual field of each eye where
the optic nerve crosses the retina, with more color in the middle of the visual field than in the
periphery, etc. (Figure 6a). In other words, it would not be the clear, full color image of our
surroundings that we consciously perceive. However, what happens is that the neurons which
specialize in processing visual images constantly “process” the images coming from the retina – they
invert the image to have it right-side up, they mask the blind spot, they remove the microsaccades of
the eye, they fill the visual periphery with color, and so on, to provide the full-blown images that you
are now perceiving as you are reading this text.

In a similar way, the stunning images that we normally see of deep space, taken by telescopes
such as Hubble are not the raw images taken by the telescopes themselves. [^2] For example, Hubble
images are post-processed in a number of ways by the astronomers, including combining a number of
Hubble images, coloring them – the original images are greyscale – removing artefacts, and
performing a series of other tasks on them before they are released to the public (Figure 6b, Figure
6c). As NASA put it, “Creating color images out of the original black-and-white exposures is equal parts
art and science”.

<ImageDescription>Figure 6a. A simulated image of how a retinal image would look like before being processed by neurons. Notice the upsidedown angle, the color in the middle with black and white in the surrounding area, the visible blood vessels, and blind spot in
  the lower right (what would be the upper left for the non-inverted image). Compare that with the right-side up, full color,
  non-distorted images you consciously perceive at the moment. [^3] Figure 6b. A section of the Pillars of the Earth image taken
  by Hubble, before being processed. Notice the black-and-white palette, the artefacts that dot the picture, the lack of detail.

So, we can say that in both cases, the visual images captured by the organism’s visual organ
(i.e. eye in the case of humans, telescopes in the case of human society) are first processed by their fundamental units (i.e. cells in the case of humans, humans in the case of human society) before being
distributed throughout the organism (i.e. becoming conscious in the case of humans, becoming
popular in the case of human society). Of course, the temporal and spatial order of magnitude differs
between the two organisms – it takes a much shorter time for cells to process the images captured by
the retina then it does for humans to process the images captured by the Hubble telescope. Also, the
distances involved when it comes to cells and the retina are much shorter than the distances involved
for telescopes and humans.

Nevertheless, the fact that we can express the same general process in a language that applies
to both organisms is a testament to their striking similarity.

## Basic unit individuality – an example of difference

Still, it is worth pointing out that there are notable differences between multicellular and multizoa
organisms. Perhaps one of the most poignant for multizoa theory is the fact that the individual humans
that make up multizoa organisms have a strong sense of individuality, one that is not found in the
individual cells which make up multicellular organisms. That does not mean that cells do not display
ingenious behavior individually. [^4]  [^5] But this sense of individuality inherent in humans is unlike
anything seen in the cellular kingdom. For example, there is no such thing as “popular cells” within
the body that all other cells know about, like there are popular people within human society, from
politicians to actors to singers. This diverging feature has two potential implications:

1. The intergenerational process of multizoa evolution through natural selection might favor the
survival and reproduction of societies that are more collective rather than individualistic, thus
eliminating individualism over time. An example such a collectivist multizoa organism could
be a society where the popular works of art created by people would be completely
anonymized, so as to strip them of any individualist connotations.

2. Human individuality might play a role in the selection of particular “multizoa traits” during the
process of multizoa evolution through natural selection in the Universe that have no parallel
to multicellular “traits” and their evolutionary trajectory. For example, a multizoa organism
that empowers that individuality in its humans might be evolutionarily successful in certain
multizoa environments, something that has no parallel in the context of multicellular
organisms.

This example aimed to show how a clear difference between multicellular and multizoa “traits”
could be dealt with in the context of an evolutionary theory that encompasses both types of
organisms.
