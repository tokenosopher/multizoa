# Chapter IX - Can Human Society Get The Sniffles?

You wake up one day next to your gorgeous...dog, get out of
bed, go to the toilet, and while looking in the mirror and wondering
how the hell you can possibly be so sexy, you see something that
wasn't there yesterday. You pluck that nose hair out, and then
you notice a second thing that wasn't there before: A red rash on
the side of your face. You consider that it may perhaps be from
sleeping with your cheek on the laptop keyboard again, so you
think nothing of it and get ready for a brand new day, until you get
to Uni for your lecture and people start asking where you are
hiding the whiskey bottle that you've obviously been indulging in
that morning judging by your looks, and may they have some.
So you storm out of the lecture hall and go to the toilet, where
you find that the red rash that you saw when you woke up has
now diligently extended all over your face, making you look like a
poor man's Mr. Potato Head fashioned out of last year’s
Christmas decorations.

Next stop, the Uni infirmary, where after being inspected by the
doctor, you are informed that you have acquired a rare case of
slapped cheek syndrome. Rare in that this syndrome generally
only appears in babies, and although you may be a babe, the
doctor points out and winks - which you find somewhat disturbing
but also strangely arousing, since it's a ridiculously attractive doc - a baby you are not.

So, you are given a topical cream and are sent on your merry
way to find the whiskey bottle which goes with your flush.
These is not an unusual occurrence for a person - well, maybe
getting slapped cheek syndrome is - but not acquiring some sort
of disease. People get sick all the time. Some diseases are less
serious, and others are more so. Some diseases are caused by
bacteria or viruses, others are caused by things going wrong in
our bodies. And no, a hangover doesn’t count.

But what about human society? Do multizoa organisms have
diseases? Can human society get the sniffles too?

Well, what’s a disease in the first place? It’s something which
causes harm to the organism, most of the time by harming or
killing the organism’s basic units. Whether we’re talking about the
common cold, diabetes or silly yak disease, these human
conditions do damage to the cells of the human body one way or
another.

<DynamicImage image={yak} alt={"an image of a yak"}/>
<ImageDescription>The dilemma of this yak: it doesn't know if it's an animal, or if it's
  silly enough to be a disease. My advice? To hell with labels. Just
  be yourself, yak. Be you. [IX-1](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

So then, a multizoa disease would be something that goes
around doing damage to the human beings within human society,
and there’s one thing that fits this description quite well. Take a
look at this picture:

<DynamicImage image={jorahMormontAndWar} alt={"an image of Jorah Mormont and a war"}/>
<ImageDescription>[IX-2, X-3](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

On the left, you have the character Jorah Mormont from Game
of Thrones revealing the Greyscale infection spreading on his
hand and neck, but still managing to look cool while doing it. Greyscale is a
fictional disease that among other things hardens the skin over
time, making brittle, dark and stone-like, similar to a reptile skin.
There are genuine skin diseases out there that are similar to it,
but none of the pictures available on them were accompanied by
such good fashion taste. Gresycale presumably kills off skin cells
as it spreads, and wreaks havoc on other cells in the body as the
disease progresses.

On the right, you have the war in Syria. Let’s look at war in terms
of human society as a whole. Wherever war spreads on the body
of human society, it results in images like the one you see above,
with dead people and dead buildings. So far, the spreading war
has resulted in the death of somewhere between 317,000 and
470,000 of human society’s people, with countless others injured
and millions forced to leave their homes behind and relocate.
About 30% of the residential buildings, and around half of the
country’s medical and educational facilities have been destroyed.
The conflict has extended across 70 percent of the Syrian area
of human society’s body, giving it more or less of a look similar to
the one you see above. Look at that picture. Does it not seem like
the flaky skin of Greyscale, but for human society? In other words,
does it not seem like a multizoa disease?

Now, as far as diseases go, war does not seem to be spread by
a pathogen, like a virus, bacteria or Chuck Norris memes.

<DynamicImage image={ghostsAroundCampfire} alt={"an image of ghosts around a campfire talking about Chuck Norris"}/>
<ImageDescription>Ghosts sit around the fire and tell Chuck Norris memes. [IX-4](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

Rather, war is similar to an autoimmune disease. In medicine,
an autoimmune disease is one characterized by the fact that the
human body’s immune cells do not recognize another group of
cells as being part of the same body even though they are, so
cells get attacked and killed off. It includes diseases such as type
1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and Chuck Norris memes. (Chuck
Norris is the only thing in existence that can both be and not be a
pathogen).

That is, more or less, what’s happening in this case. Humans
that are part of human society’s body are attacking other humans
that are part of human society’s body, just like in autoimmune
diseases some cells of a person’s body are attacking other cells
of the same body.

In that sense, if war was to be compared to a skin disease it
would be more like psoriasis, an autoimmune disease where the
skin becomes red and flaky, caused by the body’s T cells
attacking skin cells.

So why is war bad? Setting aside the commonly known fact
that, you know, war is not fun for anyone involved. First, the
biological perspective. A disease lowers the desire and ability of
an organism to reproduce. Have your ever tried getting funky
while being sick or injured? Exactly. This applies to multizoa
organisms as well. Our human society's energy is too busy
focusing on the disease it currently has to seriously turn its
worldwide resources towards establishing colonies on other
planets.

Then, a disease can stunt an organism’s growth, leaving it
underdeveloped. Our human society is definitely still in its
growing stages with a population projected to increase by a
couple of billion until 2050, so how is having a serious disease
like war affecting its development - both physical and cognitive?

Then, disease lowers an organism's chances of survival - for
example, in the wild a sick or wounded animal is more likely to be
killed off than a healthy one, because a healthy one is better able
to protect itself against unforeseen dangers, be it a predator,
some unexpected change in its environment like a drought that
leaves it without food and water, or lack of sleep caused by loud
music coming from their neighbors practicing their dance moves.

<DynamicImage image={grizzlyBearDancing} alt="Grizzly bear dancing next to the lake" />
<ImageDescription>The rabbit: Hey bear, turn that music down, will ya? The hawk will
  probably try to hunt me again tomorrow, and I'm trying to get
  some rest before that. [IX-5](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

And it's the same with multizoa organisms. A multizoa organism
that is sick or wounded may not be as able to protect itself against
unforeseen threats coming from its environment. Our human
society is lucky in that its environment is relatively stable and
challenge free for the moment, so even though its disease
weakens it, it is still surviving, and even in certain senses thriving.
I mean, Chewbacca mom! ‘nuff said. But we should use this
window of environmental stability to make our society developed
and strong rather than simply survive a self-caused disease
because truly, as humans our enemy is not each other, it is the
**darwinian natural selection process applied to multizoa
organisms,** whose judgments can come swiftly and without any
sort of empathy or remorse for our human society as Discovery
Channel shows us they do for animals in nature. It can be a rock
coming from space, some major geological change on Earth,
some new crop disease that threatens to wipe out our food
supply, or Chuck Norris going rogue…Oh God, just the thought
of that last one makes me want to give up and die.

But whatever the next challenge will be, a sick human society
will have a much tougher chance surviving it than a healthy one.
So, in light of the new information presented in this book, wasting
anymore resources, energy, human time and potential on
perpetuating a multizoa disease is, biologically speaking, as
ignorant as tying your dog's leash to your Formula 1 racing car
because it has no back seats and then driving away full speed
assuming that Rex will be fiiiine.

The second category of reasons for why war is bad involves the
human perspective, for which I would like to call out the 10.000
rule.

The 10.000 hour rule basically says that whatever you practice
for 10.000 hours, you can become an expert at. Some people
have clocked 10.000 hours of playing the video game Star Wars
Jedi Academy and have become experts at it, some people have
clocked 10.000 hours of riding unicycles and have become
experts at it, and some people have clocked 10.000 hours of
wielding machine guns and have become experts at it. Now of
course, it’s not guaranteed that practicing something for 10.000
hours will make you an expert.

There are other factors such as the underlying talent involved,
genetic make-up when it comes to certain activities such as
sports or pulling cars with your testicles, and the kind of practice
engaged in, whether it’s pushing (or pulling) to perfect or simply
rote practice. But what’s certain is that without practice, you can
never become good at any activity. Practice is the bedrock of
expertise.

<DynamicImage image={extremeIroning} alt={"A person ironing underwater with a shark getting ready to take a bite of them."} />
<ImageDescription>Extreme Ironing - The power of practice and genes meet in this very impressive demonstration of the kind of activities boredom can get you into. Never get bored kids! [IX-6](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

I want to expand on the 10.000 hour rule a little bit, and say that
whatever you repeatedly do when you’re young, you can easily
develop an emotional connection with and might want to repeat
doing throughout your life. For some, it means eating at
McDonalds with their family when they were kids. For others, it
means carrying around sawed off shotguns in their youth, and
looking out for strange activity around their village to warn people
of incoming attacks from rebel camps. It kind of becomes part of
your specialization. Similar to how stem cells can specialize into
skin cells, or brain cells, or any other cells based on the
environment that you initially put them in. And why would we want
people to specialize in things that are related to war? That just
has a very big chance of perpetuating into more war.

And second, it’s worth pointing out that in the course of 10.000
hours of practice you are more likely to have become usefully
creative in a field. 10.000 hours of doing physics will make you
have such a good grasp of physics that you might come out with
a physics paper that adds to the field. 10.000 hours of playing
Civilization IV will make you build cities in that game of a kind that
no one’s ever seen. 10.000 hours of playing ultimate Frisbee will
make you have Frisbee in your blood to the point where you may
invent some kind of double backflip blind throw with a 60 degree
curve that will have your name on it. 10.000 hours of writing will
enable you to write things of the type you’re reading. And why
would we want anyone to clock 10.000 hours in warfare and
become usefully creative in things related to it? That’s the kind of
stuff that leads to the development of suicide bombing, of
ingenious terror tactics, of some heavy-duty knife wielding.

<DynamicImage image={beheadingTechnique} alt="Two guards standing next to a prisoner" />
<ImageDescription>“Hey Jimmy, come here and check this out. After
  years of wielding knives I’ve invented this:” Beheads the prisoner
  in one effortless swoop. “I call it the one-swoosh-beheading trick.
  Want me to teach you? It’s all in the wrist. [IX-7](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

But if the same people would grow up in a different
environment, one that has nothing to do with war, they wouldn’t
practice in that field and become usefully creative in it. In fact,
they might practice for 10.000 hours in another field, and that
same creative modjo could now yield something totally different
and positive, like the invention of an automatic pancake making
machine. Mmm, pancakes!

As a side note, the 10.000 hour rule is also related to the idea
from the last chapter that if you free up people’s time, the world
will become a better place, essentially. That’s because more
people could clock in 10.000 hours in things other than repetitive
labour or satisfying their basic necessities, becoming usefully
creative in those fields and potentially leading to new possibilities,
new inventions in those fields for all of the world’s people to use
and benefit from.

Now that we’ve established the fact that war is a multizoa
disease, as well as pointed out some of the obvious and less
obvious pitfalls of war, how do we stop the disease? Well
obviously I don't know the complete answer, but I know
something that can help! Can you guess? Yes, it’s human
society’s consciousness! And if you didn’t guess, drop and give
me 20.

<DynamicImage image={kidDoingPushups} alt="A kid doing pushups on burning coals." />
<ImageDescription>“I am sorry, I have failed you.” Geez kid, I was only kidding. The burning coals are a step too far. [IX-8](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

So what about human society’s consciousness am I suggesting
can end wars, exactly? Naturally, it entails putting up images of
cute looking sad puppies all over the world with the caption
“Zdoop da warz."

<DynamicImage image={zdoopDaWarz1} alt="A cute puppy with meme text underneath that reads 'zdoop da warz'" />
<ImageDescription>You tell’em, cute puppy! But put a little bit more sadness into it
  next time, furl those cute little eyebrows. [IX-9](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

But seriously, art. One of the gruesome results of the war
mentioned earlier has been the large number of refugees that
have emerged from Syria. There are approximately 6 million
Syrian refugees outside of the country spread throughout the
world, out of which about 10% are sheltered in refugee camps.
Many of these people find themselves with limited resources, little
possibility for further education, little diversity in recreational
activities, little chances to dance naked in the wild, except if they
happened to cross borders through a jungle that had magic
mushrooms, and one of them happened to be a botanist. So, little
chance. Approximately 2 million of these refugees are children.

Now, the theory of consciousness laid out in this book explains
that whatever works of art people throughout human society
popularize bring with them resources and human creativity. It
doesn’t matter where these works of art stem from as long as they
become popular.

So, one of the solutions gleamed from this book could be for the
children, who have experienced the effects of war like no one
else, to be given the chance to specialize in channeling their
passion and experiences into making works of art, and in doing
so to wake up the entire human society to what is going on in their
home country. And this doesn’t simply mean drawings, or
sculptures. The end goal would be to produce high quality works
of art that rival blockbuster movies and internationally renowned
songs, which can and will want to be shared by people
everywhere. (The kind of stuff that multiple people which have put
in or are going for 10.000 hours in their fields working together
can get you.)

Why? The reasoning has multiple angles.

First, we talked before the fact that whatever human society’s
consciousness focuses on attracts with it resources as well as
human creativity. If refugees were to make works of art that
become popular throughout human society, they could then
channel the resources that come with that into improving the
quality of life for refugees all around the world.

Second, and perhaps most importantly, if the Syrian refugees
learn to channel their passion into producing works of art that
displays their situation in a way that draws empathy from
everyone watching but that is also good enough to be a musthave for the general population - works of art that basically
everyone will want to experience - as those works of art become
popular, the sense of empathy that comes with them will
essentially make human society consciously aware that
something seriously wrong is going on in the Syrian part of Her
Body and will seek to heal it as naturally as a human who realizes
they’ve just been injured turns their attention to tend to their
wound.

In light of this proposition, some of the resources that go into
helping refugees can be in the direction of allowing the people,
and especially the children to learn to express themselves
through art: Give them not just pens, but cameras. Build not just
schools, but movie studios, animation studios. Give them not just
training in science and engineering, but special effects training.
Allow the people, and especially the children to learn to express
themselves through art, so that they become experts through the
time they invest in it, so that the art that they produce in
combination with their experience and their passion will make the
entire world sympathize, and empathize. Just like the movies on
Nazi history has been doing for the Jewish plight retrospectively
for decades through documentaries, movies, etc., have art of the
same high quality do it for the atrocious plights that people
experience today.

I mean, have you ever seen Schindler's list? If you don't cry at
that movie you're a monster. What about a Schindler's list for
people of Syria, done now while it can affect how refugees are
received? What about not just one movie, but 10, 100, 40,000?
How about not just movies, but art of various kinds that people
like to experience and own? How about not just works of art that
make people sad, but that make them happy, elated, hungry,
sexy? How many works of art will it take for people to feel that
enough is enough? And I mean everyone - from the people in the
world’s parliaments, to the people in their homes, to the people in
the offices, to the people on the street? Because war cannot go
on without human time being invested in it, so if the works of art
that become popular worldwide have the effect of stopping every
person from engaging in war, the war will stop. It’s as simple as
that. Works of art can have miraculous effects. Just look at Martin
Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech. Just look at Thomas
Nast’s pictures of Santa Claus. Just look at Bruce Lee’s The Big
Boss movie. Just look at these legs:

<DynamicImage image={legsOrHotdogs} alt="Legs or hotdogs next to a pool" />
<ImageDescription>Or are they in fact hot dogs? [IX-10](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>

Anyway, the point is that this is what I feel fighting this war is
about. It’s what pushed me to write this book, really…Because
given how connected this world is, given how we’re all part of the
same multizoa organism, I feel that I am a part of the war, and
I’ve vowed to be a warrior in it even if I am so fantastically lucky
to live in the part of the world that I am living. And so, I’ve put
every other part of my life on the backburner to write this, just like
war takes over the life of the people directly involved in it. The
pen is my machine gun (well really the keyboard on my computer
is, but let’s not get technical) the words in this book are my bullets.
But the bullets are not aimed at other people, they are aimed at
the war itself, because killing more people in the name of stopping
the war is like wiping your butt with dried poop after pooping: Just
because it’s dry, it doesn’t mean it’s not just more poop. These
words are aimed at the ignorance that allows the input of human
time into war. Put human time into relieving the causes of war
instead.

So, my advice: You want to fight in the war? Enlist in the army
of artists, and generate works of art around why war sucks for
everybody, why war is biologically unsound, why war is ridiculous,
why war is illogical, why war is raw spelled backwards, until
human society becomes completely conscious of it. Works of art
so good that they cannot be ignored, with the same passion as if
you had a machine gun in your hand, with an urgency as if bullets
were flying past your head every day. Because whether or not
they are for you, for some people part of this organism that we
are all part of, they are. They freakin’ are!

<DynamicImage image={zdoopDaWarz2} alt="A sad cute puppy dressed as a pacifist" />
<ImageDescription>I mean, look at those eyes. How can people not drop their
  machine guns and start saying “awwww” when they see this? [IX-11](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-ix---can-human-society-get-the-sniffles)</ImageDescription>
