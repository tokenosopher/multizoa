# Epilogue

In the epilogue, I could have talked about money as a multizoa
hormone more. Or, I could have referred to human society’s
endocrine system [^1], and how some people are endocrine humans,
releasing money into human society. I could have listed some of
the other hormones of human society, such as coffee, or I could
have had some coffee and forgotten about this chapter
altogether, but no. Instead, what I want to close off with is what
my version of the ideal world would look like. That, and peanuts.

The ideal world is one in which no one does repetitive labour,
because all of that type of work would be done by robots who love
that stuff, and with that there'd be no more people working to
make ends meat because there’d be no reason for it, so every
single human being would be out there to have fun and enjoy their
time in the world. Also, peanuts are not actually nuts like
chestnuts or cashews, they're really a type of legume, which
makes them vegetables.

A world in which worries like hunger, thirst, lack of shelter is so
far from everyone's minds, it's only talked about in history
textbooks. Also, someone once pushed a peanut to the top of
Pike’s Peak (14,100 feet) using his nose in 4 days, 23 hours, 47
minutes and 3 seconds. Why? We can only assume it's because
the guy's pants had no pockets to carry the peanut in.

A world in which everybody's as social with everyone they meet
as snakes in a snake pit, or drunken best friends:

  I love you brah ! No, I love you! No, I love you more! No, I've
  always loved you. No, I have a picture of you naked in my wallet.
  Wait, what? [X-1](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#epilogue)
</ImageDescription>

Why? Because it's been proven over and over again that the
richer the social life, the bigger the increase in happiness levels
across the board, the less mental problems[^2] and at a society level
the more thriving the culture due to cross fertilization of ideas and
the build-up of diverse teams of individuals to tackle on projects[^3].
And besides, how else would you stumble upon people that you
truly connect with, if not by meeting as many people as possible
until you hear that "click" in your head? Also, you can find different
peanut flavors when you go to the store, like salty, chocolate
peanuts and my favorite: nutty!

A world in which every field, from genetics to physics to
programming to gymnastics is geared towards making the world
a better place for the greatest number of people because it would
just be common sense in a society that is self-aware, and so
corruption would go the way of the gun holster…it would only
come up in b-rated Western movies. Also, The United States
Food and Drug Administration allows one pound of peanut butter
to contain a maximum of 150 insect fragments and five rodent
hairs…I wonder how they count that.

A world in which rather than needing to choose between a good
or a bad situation, the question that you will have to answer
throughout your life will be: “If all roads lead to heaven, which one
will I choose?” Also, there are many ways to eat peanuts. You
can eat them raw, you can eat them out of a bag, you can hurl
them up in the air and catch them in your mouth, you can throw it
in other's people's mouths and then kiss it out of them...

A world in which people's time is valued to its maximum, and in
which all of society seeks to free as much human time as possible
from the very beginning of any activity or project, with no
repetitive labour involved, whether we're talking about building
homes, designing the new line of starships, or propelling a beaver
into a tree hole half a mile away.[^4] Why? Because it would be
obvious that human time is the most precious asset that human
society owns, and it should therefore be used intelligently. Also,
George Washington Carver promoted over 300 ways to use
peanuts, including as an insecticide, face powder, peanut
sausage and shampoo. I wonder who would win in a showdown
between eggs and peanuts:

<ImageDescription>The milk: C’mon guys, we’re all friends here. We…we can work
  this out. IIIII know, let’s make some cake together! [X-2](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#epilogue)</ImageDescription>

A world in which everyone's childhood is filled with loving
experiences growing up, experiences that lead them to become
secure, fun loving, confident individuals who are not afraid to take
chances when the benefits prove major...like trying out pasta with
canned beans instead of tomato sauce. Ooh, living on the edge!
Also, guess what's ‘stunap’ spelled backwards? That's right,
‘panuts’, which is very similar to the word ‘peanuts’.

A world in which we would be going to school, cause we would
still need to learn how to read and write and how to throw pieces
of paper into the people around us without them noticing, but
beyond that our education would be to learn stuff that's useful for
us as individuals, that we consider useful, like how to memorize
whatever we want easily and effortlessly instead of just having to
do rote memorization for exams, or learning how to throw pieces
of paper towards the people around us without them noticing A
SECOND TIME! (In other words, learn magic.) This without losing
the social perks of being in school, like making new friends,
hanging out with them, house parties, vowing to never get drunk
again while your bf is holding your head over the toilet. Ah, sweet
memories! Also, if you first put a scoop of peanut butter in an ice
cream cone before putting in the ice cream, it will prevent the ice
cream from dripping through the bottom. Bet you didn't think of
that, did you, Mr. George Washington Carver?

A world in which people would be so happy and would have at
their disposal so many different ways of achieving happiness that
everyone would start realizing that too much happiness isn't
necessarily good for you and experts would start recommending
a diet of feelings...a little melancholy here, a touch of elation
there, a sprinkle of the feeling of novelty there. And people would
compare the emergence of such diets of feelings to the food diets
that our generation came up with to deal with the enormous
amounts of sugar that suddenly became available everywhere. A
balanced diet of feelings is healthy for you even though
happiness is available in abundance, "feeling specialists" would
say, just like nutrition specialists now say that a balanced food
diet is healthy for you. Of course, that wouldn't stop us from going
on happiness binges from time to time, just for the hell of it. Also,
peanut sculpture is a thing:

<ImageDescription>Is that…is that the peanut version of Morticia and Gomez from
  Addams Family? [X-3](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#epilogue)</ImageDescription>

A world in which everyone would be free to do whatever,
because past generations of people would have put their human
time into fields that lead to that freedom, from robotics to remove
repetitive labour, genetics to create some kind of food that has
the perfect balance of nutrients and is easy to grow, architecture
so as to build the housing that can take care of all basic human
needs, education to create the most fun, engaging and
personalized learning environment, to engineering so as to make
some sort of thing that could light up a room at night and would
replace dangerous kerosene lamps which have led to so many
fires. Oh wait, we already have that last one, they're called
lightbulbs! We're so ahead of the curve. Also, the world’s largest
peanut butter and jelly sandwich weighed 608 kilograms, or 1342
pounds.

So, what kind of world would you want to see? Actually, what
kind of world would we all want to see, if we all asked ourselves
this question and pooled in the answers? And if it would seem
like a very unlikely world, it’s really not. We can help build it. How?
By giving people freedom of time, and by encouraging them to
use that time to specialize in the fields that will make that world a
reality. Computer engineering, architecture, etc. Let the people
choose what is right for them, it’s how they do their best work.
Their path may take them through learning how to juggle in a
circus, to being a pilot in some video game, to being an activist to
then being a monk and in the end becoming the computer
engineer that will design the code that will run on the first robot
butler. If they have time on their hands they can make informed
decisions. Also, oh my god, I fucking love peanuts!
