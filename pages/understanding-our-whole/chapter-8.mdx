# Chapter VIII - How To Get Human Society To Reproduce

Now those more skeptical among you may think that taking
people cheaply and affordably into outer space is a sensationally
complicated thing, like making a cake that looks like Shrek.

But if you thought that's complicated, then how about what it
would take to take human society to establish a colony on Mars
and thus reproduce? That would be the equivalent of baking a
cake that looks like a Chef that looks like Shrek.

<DynamicImage image={ShrekTheChef} alt={"Shrek as a chef...Or a cake as Shrek the Chef. Who knows?"}/>

  When you realize that you ARE the cake. [VIII-1](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)

For to reach Mars, you first have to build a rocket that can ride
about 1000 times the distance between Earth and the moon.
Then you have to deal with cancer inducing radiation along the 6
month trip, during which your body would experience all kinds of
weakening effects due to zero gravity, like bone density loss,
muscle loss and for guys, an inability to get an erection. What?

Ok, I'm out!

Then you have to land on Mars after reaching speeds like 4
miles per second along the way, but because the Red Planet only
has a light atmosphere in which parachutes don’t work very well,
it won't be easy. Just ask one of the 4 crash landings out of the
13 landers sent to Mars by human society.

Which is why when the rover Curiosity made is successfully on
the planet in 2012, the serious scientists at NASA jumped out of
their seats like they were die hard soccer fans witnessing their
team winning the World Cup.

<DynamicImage image={NasaScientistsCheering} alt="Nasa Scientists Cheering in Mission Control"/>
<ImageDescription>
  Don't get so excited kids...it only means that a trip that took 352
  million miles, 7000 people working on it over 8 years and 2.5
  billion dollars was successful. Well, wait… [VIII-2](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)
</ImageDescription>

Then if you do land a manned crew on Earth, there is the little
task of surviving, which won't be like building a tent on the beach,
considering that temperatures average -60 degrees Celsius but
can fluctuate wildly, from +20 degrees on a summer day to -90 degrees once nighttime sets. Also, because of the thin Martian
atmosphere, your saliva, tears and the lining of your lungs will boil
if in contact with Martian air, all of which means that people will
need to stay indoors, or wear spacesuits when traveling. But for
there to be ‘indoors’ someone would have to build
accommodations, and for the people to survive they would also
need food, and water, and fresh underwear, and power, which is
a whole other story in a place where dust storms can take over
the entire planet in a flash, wiping out any view of the sun for
endless stretches of time – and also covering any freshly hungout-to-dry underwear with dust.

<DynamicImage image={Mars} alt="Mars"/>
<ImageDescription>Yes, come live on Mars. Our planet’s name is just like the candy
  bar's! [VIII-3](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)</ImageDescription>

And these are just some of the challenges that what we can
foresee, but since we've never done it before, we can't foresee
everything, can we?
I mean, unforeseen things can happen from baking toast. Just
ask the owners of this one:

<DynamicImage image={ToasterOnFire} alt="Toaster on fire"/>
<ImageDescription>Puts a whole new spin on burnt toast. [VIII-4](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)</ImageDescription>

What this all means is that reproducing human society on Mars
is a hugely, bewilderingly complicated task. A task that requires
a lot of human innovation for answers like: What kind of engine
will drive the spacecrafts traveling from Earth to Mars? What kind
of coating would we need to develop for the people onboard the
spacecrafts to not get radiation poisoning on the way? How will
we land the people on Mars? How will the people survive on the
planet - what kind of food, of housing, of transportation will they
have? How will they have clean water? What kind of system of
organization will they have? How will they not just survive, but
thrive on the Red Planet? How will they build the things they
need, like tools and machines and buildings and factories? How
will they handle all of the violent dust storms that will cover the
Martian surface? How will they be able to handle the situation of
waking up in the middle of the night with a serious case of
needing to use the toilet?

These are just a tiny fraction of the questions which will have to
be worked out while preparing for the colonization of Mars, and
looking at them it becomes clear that it won't just take one brilliant
mind, or two brilliant minds to achieve. It will take countless
healthy, well-developed human minds from throughout human
society cooperating to have this happen. People working on all of the various nuts and bolts that would go into such a mission.

Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX put it well when he said “What a
lot of people don’t appreciate is that technology does not
automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of really strong
engineering talent is applied to the problem.”

Luckily, if our assumptions from the last chapter are correct,
once we will be able to take our own trip on the smooth ridin’
KissMyBum 200 and see human society from space, there’ll be a
lot of enlightened minds ready and willing to help with these
engineering problems. In fact, reading this book might make you
so motivated to get involved, that you might feel like picking up a
hammer and chisel right now, and start engineering a reliable
martian toilet for future settlers out of the tree in your backyard.
Unluckily, there’s just one little problem: time.

Statistically speaking, most people are already occupied with
other stuff, like how to survive in a world where you have to spend
most of your time making money to pay for your rent or mortgage,
pay your bills and buy food, with a little left over for your hobbies
if you're fortunate, whether they are watching your favorite
miniseries, spending time with your kids, partying, writing or
eating furniture.

That's while you might have to deal with the mental baggage
that comes from childhood trauma that's prevalent in our world,
whether it's war, poverty, abuse, neglect, having one of your dolls
come to life and try to kill you, all of which can leave you seriously
fucked up in the head when you're older, unable to form healthy
relationships, to experience healthy love, to deal with everyday
stresses, to visit doll shops....basically, a huge obstacle in having
someone reach their full potential, that requires a lot of time and
mental energy to overcome.

<DynamicImage image={ChuckyScaringChild} alt={"Chucky scaring child"} />
<ImageDescription>You know Chucky, even if I get out of this alive, this experience

And what people usually spend their time on is important,
because human time is what gets things done, whether we’re
talking about the goal of reproducing human society or the goal
of building a humongous slingshot that can propel a beaver into
a tree hole half a mile away. In fact, everything that you see
around you…the buildings, the cars, the books, the computers,
the TV’s, the clothes, the words, the choo choo trains, all of it is
a product of human time. It’s the result of people investing their
time into inventing, designing, perfecting, building those things,
countless people from all around the world, over generations.
And the more human time is put into something, the more diverse
and sophisticated that something tends to become. Just think of
one of the things that all humans invest their time in: Food. How
many things related to food are there in the world to experience?
Or think of sex. How many things related to sex are there to try
out? Or think of housing. How many housing types are there in
the world? Or think of music. How many different genres, songs,
symphonies, musical instruments are there? All of these
possibilities when it comes to food, sex, housing, music come
from people all around the world putting human time into it, and
from the human creativity that naturally buzzes around whatever
human time gets invested in. Human time is the most precious
resource human society has, it is literally the moving energy of
human society.

Even money is not valuable in and of itself, it’s valuable
because it influences what people spend their time on. When
someone gets paid to do something, they are basically asked to
invest their human time in whatever their “work” is, whether it’s
flipping burgers or flipping themselves in mid-air at a circus or
flipping people off in a movie as actors. That’s money’s role as a
multizoa hormone. In classical biology, hormones are defined as
something that “stimulates specific cells or tissues into action,”
and money stimulates humans and human networks into actions
that are required for them to earn that money. That just means
that it stimulates them to invest their precious human time into
those activities.

**Bringing something into the popular eye of human society -
that is, into human society’s consciousness - is just one
way of saying that we are investing human time into it.**
Because in order for that something to become popular, people
would have to talk about it - which is human time. Works of art
that are created by people would have to include it - from news
articles to movies to documentaries - which is human time.
People would have to strip naked and dance around their house
while thinking about it, which is human time. Wait, is that just me?
Anyway, the more human time would be invested in that
something, the more the creativity that naturally buzzes around
whatever human time is invested in would develop it, would make
it more sophisticated; The more resources would be concentrated
around it, and this is true whether we’re talking about the
popularity of a famous person, the idea that Y am a multizoa
organism, mY reproduction, or cheesecake - **Popularity is
human time**, and human time is the fundamental growth agent
within human society.

That being said, if most of people’s time is occupied with the
basics, like working to pay the bills, then the amount of human
time people have to invest in whatever popular subject is floating
within human society will be limited. It’s one thing to go into space
and see human society, experience the overview effect then
come back to an 8 hour job that takes up most of your time and
energy, and it’s another thing to go into space, see human society
growing on the surface of Earth, experience the overview effect
then come back and be able to put your precious human time into
a field relating to the reproduction of human society for example
without having to worry how you are going to pay the bills next
month or put food on the table or buy tickets for that movie you’ve
been waiting to come out.

The more human time each person has available to play around
with on their own terms, the more of that time can be directed to
whatever would benefit human society as a whole - such as
human society’s reproduction - once human society’s self-awareness kicks in, bringing in the unique skills, abilities,
possibilities that person has into the field.

So, it seems that one of the things that we need to do in
conjunction with developing human society’s self-awareness via
the overview effect is to look at how we can free up human time.
That’s because with human society becoming self-aware, people
would choose to invest at least some of their freed up human time
into fields that will benefit human society as a whole out of their
own free will, including its ability to reproduce. As we’ve hinted
before, much of human time is currently occupied with:

a. Doing repetitive labour - whether we’re referring to kids in
Congo mining cobalt for 12 hours a day, farmers in China tilling
the soil every day, or clerks at fast-food restaurants in the UK and
USA preparing hamburgers for 12 hours a day. A lot of this
repetitive labour is done because for one, doing that sort of work
is the only option a lot of people have available to ensure life’s
basic necessities: food, a home, clean underwear. And also, it’s
done because somebody’s got to do it - for example, if there
would be no one working at fast food restaurants, fast food
restaurants couldn’t function, and then where would Fred buy his
super extra large meal every morning on the way to his own nonglamorous job?

b. Dealing with the psychological issues that mostly comes from
childhood trauma such as poverty, war, neglect or parental
abuse, whether we’re referring to the locked up murderer or the
psycho ex-girlfriend. Much of time people waste on arguments,
on addictive behaviors, on self-destructing rampages where
people suddenly stop their cars in the middle of the street, take
out their baseball bats and start hitting everything in sight is due
to that.

<DynamicImage image={ManWithBaseballBat} alt="An angry man dressed in a fancy suit that is standing on the roof of a car, breaking" />
<ImageDescription>You would be dealing with your emotions in a healthier way if you would’ve had a nice childhood. Granted, it wouldn’t be as entertaining for the rest of us. [VIII-6](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)</ImageDescription>

How do we free up human time from these kinds of activities?
  Well, by using the new tool that we have at our disposal, of
course: human society’s consciousness, or the popularity of
subjects within human society. We know that popularity brings
with it human creativity and resources. Yes, for now the
consciousness of human society may not have reached its full
potential with human time being so filled. You may know exactly
what I mean when you think about what takes up most of your
own time. But even at this stage human society’s consciousness
can be very powerful, extremely powerful. And by focusing it on
works of art that have the potential to eliminate the two factors
that are taking up human time described above, it may very well
free up that time via the resources and the human creativity that
human society’s consciousness brings.

So what works of art are we specifically referring to? Well, for
the repetitive labour the problem seems to be twofold. First, we
need to find a way of providing people with their basic necessities
- food, water, shelter, electricity, without much need for human
time to be invested in maintenance. Earthships for example are a
good option for that as a first step - they are homes built from
recyclable materials that can be off grid and use solar panels,
water recycling and even a greenhouse to provide those basic
necessities.

<DynamicImage image={Earthship} alt="An Earthship" />
<ImageDescription>Plus, these things look cool. [VIII-7](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)</ImageDescription>

Of course, as human time would be invested in them during
their rise to popularity if they would become the focus of human
society’s consciousness, the resources and human creativity that
would accompany it would likely improve them and make them
even more self-sufficient and reliable then they already are, so
think of the current design as step one.

Second, we need to remove repetitive labour without the human
pleasures that come as fruits of that repetitive labour. In other
words, this isn’t about not eating at a fancy restaurant because
you don’t want human time to be invested in the repetitive labour
of waitering, this is just about not having human time invested in
the repetitive labour of waitering, whilst still being able to eat at a
fancy restaurant.

For that, we can simply have robots take over the job. The field
of robotics has already come a long way. I mean, a robot
developed by Boston Dynamics was able to do a backflip in 2017,
for God’s sake!

<DynamicImage image={robotDoingBackflip} alt="A robot doing a backflip" />
<ImageDescription>Congratulations on doing a backflip. Now, can you deliver milk
  cartons to people every morning, so that humans don’t have to? [VIII-8](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)</ImageDescription>

What do you think the human creativity and resources that
accompany human society’s consciousness will be able to do in
the field of robotics if that conscious focus would be directed
towards it with the aim of removing repetitive labour? It may take
a bit of time, that’s true, but before long you’ll find robots that
would make a shake at your nearest bar, or robots that bag your
food at your nearest check-out counter, or robots that make your
clothes from start to finish. In fact, robot bartenders already exist
on some cruise ships.

<DynamicImage image={robotBartender} alt="A robot bartender arm serving a glass of wine" />
<ImageDescription>Hey, toots. Have you been working here for long? [VIII-9](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)</ImageDescription>

So let’s focus our time and energy on these robots, on this field,
and see it grow and develop in the direction of removing repetitive
labour for people.

For point b., dealing with psychological issues, much of which
comes from childhood trauma, I suggest bringing into human
society’s consciousness Mr. T’s motivational video “Be
somebody….Or be somebody’s fool,” a production whose aim is
to put a young audience on the right track.

<DynamicImage image={mrT} alt="Mr. T" />
<ImageDescription>Here, Mr T gives his advice on fashion: “Hey, everybody’s gotta
  wear clothes. And if you don’t, you get arrested.” Thanks, Mr. T! [VIII-10](/understanding-our-whole/image-sources#chapter-viii---how-to-make-human-society-aware-that-she-is-a-living-organism)</ImageDescription>

Of course, childhood trauma is oftentimes an indirect result of
other issues such as the ones we’ve mentioned: poverty, war and
neglect. Poverty has a lot to do with a lack of basic necessities,
of course, which we’ve somewhat tackled in point a. We will be
discussing war in the next chapter.

What does bringing things such as Earthships and robots into
human society’s consciousness mean? It literally means making
them popular. The more popular they are, the more resources will
be focused on them and the companies that make them, the more
human creativity will buzz around them. And popularity means
many things: From it being shared on social media, to it being on
the news, to it being a part of human art such as songs, movies,
documentaries, to it being talked about among friends or family,
to people generally getting involved in activities that are around
it, being creative with it. We each decide how much human time
we have at our disposal to invest in that popularity, but what
makes these things special is that the more time is invested in
them, the more there is a possibility that more human time would
become available, which could then be centered on freeing up
more human time, or concentrated around human society’s
reproduction and other themes that concern humans society as a
whole.

Now this chapter wasn’t about minimizing the amazing work
coming from teams already engaged in developing the
technological innovations that would allow human society to
establish a colony on Mars, from Elon Musk's SpaceX, to NASA,
to MarsOne, Mars Direct to a few other teams. In fact their work
is a godsend. We need better and more efficient rockets that
could travel into low-earth orbit. That would allow people to
cheaply and reliably experience the overview effect, an important
step in the development of human society’s self awareness. The
work of these teams will undoubtedly add to that, even if
indirectly.

Beyond that, sure, given enough time these teams of people
might even succeed to establish a Mars colony, with great strife.

A few thousand people working on getting humans on Mars and
succeeding, despite many of the other 7.5 billion people on Earth
not doing very well and thus not having the time to help with this
monumental task. And that's a big if, considering the magnitude
of challenges we barely scratched the surface of earlier. But even
if possible, would we even want it to happen this way?

Because freeing up human time is not just about reproducing
human society. It’s about increasing the “thinking power” of
human society. A human society whose people can choose what
to spend their time on without having to worry about their next
meal can become a nimble society, one which can adapt to new
circumstances and quickly shift its conscious focus to overcome
whatever new challenges its environment throws at it - be it an
incoming asteroid from space, a volcano eruption or an invasion
of flying tricycles that have lied dormant in Earth’s crust for eons.
In fact, humans are arguably the most successful life form on
Earth, if you don’t count chickens, and this is a direct result of
their “thinking power” enabling them to adapt to almost any
environment. Where does that thinking power come from? Brain
cells. The human has been found to possess the most number of
neurons out of all the animals in the animal kingdom. [^1] And
neurons are cells notorious for their ability to “reorganize”,
something which they wouldn’t be able to do if they had to worry
where they would get their glucose from the next day as a
consequence. Luckily, thanks to the efficient nutrient distribution
system of the human body, they don’t have to.

By freeing up human time in the manner we’ve laid out in this
chapter, we would start providing people with the possibility of
reorganizing around whatever they see of importance without
them having to worry that they’d be losing their house or won’t
have anything to eat the next day, leading to an adaptable
multizoa organism due to its “thinking power”.

And now, we’ve talked earlier about the fact that multizoa
organisms inherit the traits of its parent organism, just like it
happens with people. That crooked nose that you have looks just
like your dads, and so too would the colony on Mars resemble
our human society in a lot of ways, especially at first. Wouldn’t we
want for the colony on Mars to inherit a maximized “thinking
power” from our society when the time comes for our society to
reproduce? That would make the Martian colony more likely to
survive in its harsh environment, it would give it more of a chance
to develop and thrive, like a human would be more likely to
survive in a new environment than a chimp due to a difference in
intelligence. Otherwise, without automatization, without efficient
housing the colony on Mars would likely develop an “upper class”
of wealthier people not doing repetitive labour and a “lower class”
of poorer people doing it just like it currently is on Earth, and that
would be not just mentally inefficient for the budding multizoa
organism, but a sad precedent to set for the multizoa tree of life,
especially when there is a different option.

Not to mention that everything that we enjoy doing in our society
was created by human time being invested in it. Whether it’s
video games, movies, basejumping, chess, participating in
marathons, all came from people putting time into coming up with
things. Even the slinky didn’t just come out of thin air, people
made that too! And the more human time there is, the more
human time and the creativity that comes with it can be free to
explore new paths and come up with new things that we all might
enjoy, like the finger skateboard. And whether you’re rich, poor,
whether you have all the possibilities in the world open to you or
you’ve never left your home town, this benefit of freed human time
applies to you, because you never know what new, amazing thing
people’s creativity can give birth to that you would could have
never even conceived of had you not heard of it, and had there
not been human time to develop and popularize it. Like helium
beer.

So, I would argue that even if at some point multizoa
reproduction could theoretically take place by having a small
group of people like the amazing guys at SpaceX just pushing
through until they manage to establish something of a colony on
Mars while the rest of human society is left dealing with the status
quo, it would still not be anywhere near as evolutionarily
successful for multizoa organisms nor as socially rewarding as
going about it by first freeing up human time.

And I have to say, if aliens do exist and are just monitoring us
from afar, how do you think they'll feel about a type of multizoa
organism which hasn't gotten its shit together in its own home
learning to reproduce and spread the culture of "not getting its
shit together" throughout the universe? It would be like the
multizoa version of allowing a virus to emerge. That'll be a good
theme for a story actually, where after people establish a colony
on Mars without freeing up human time on Earth first, they begin
to uncover remnants of a past colony on the Red Planet that
appears to be very much human as well. Only to eventually have
aliens descend on Mars to see what kind of culture human society
would spread by reproducing this time, and say “No, this is not
good either. Still too divisive. Try again!" And wipe human society
on both Mars and Earth "once more", like it turned out they had
done in the past...taking humans back to the Stone Age on Earth.
We don't want that, do we? Also, at least one alien should be
played by Catherine-Zeta Jones, which would indicate that aliens
are beautiful, and ultimately mean well for the universe.
So in regards to the amazing teams mentioned that are looking
to get on Mars ASAP, by all means, yes! Build better, more
efficient rockets. Do it even with the long term goal of taking
people to Mars. Aim for the stars to reach the moon. Think of how
a Mars colony would work.

But once human society’s self-awareness develops in part as a
consequence of improved spacecrafts, perhaps a sensible move
would be to first turn our attention towards Earth before a serious
attempt to colonize Mars, and help develop every square inch of
our society into a place that people can flourish in, where humans
have freedom with their time so that the technological innovations
that will lead to human society reproducing will arise naturally
from people in all corners of the world, as effortlessly as new
musical genres spring up nowadays. I mean, freak folk? Brostep?
Scottish pirate metal? THAT’S how much human creativity
human time can bring. Reproducing human society will be a piece
of cake.
